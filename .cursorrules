Codebase Overview
This codebase appears to be part of a web application built using React and TypeScript. It is structured to support a landing page, authentication flows, and a dashboard for logged-in users. The application integrates with Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
Stack and Key Technologies

Framework: React
TypeScript: Used for type-safe code across the frontend
Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
Supabase: Open-source Firebase alternative used for backend services including authentication, database, and storage
Supabase Auth: Used for authentication, specifically with Kakao OAuth integration

Purpose and Functionality
Routing & Navigation

Custom Routing Solution: The application implements custom client-side routing without React Router, including:

State-based route management
Custom navigation components
Protected routes with authentication checks
Layout composition through component composition



Authentication
The application includes a comprehensive authentication flow:

Login: Users can log in using Kakao Auth integrated with Supabase OAuth
Signup: New users can sign up with Kakao Auth
Logout: Users can log out
Auth State Management: Uses Supabase auth state listeners with React context

User Interface

Landing Page: Contains components like SubmitButton, LoginPage, and LogoutModal
Dashboard: For logged-in users, showing personalized content and navigation
Error Handling: Uses custom error boundaries and error states

Data Management

Supabase Client: For database interactions and managing authenticated sessions
Custom Data Fetching: Implements custom hooks for data fetching patterns
Type-safe API: TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across API boundaries

Layout Components

Navbar: A responsive navbar for the landing page and public pages
Navigation Component: A navigation component for the dashboard and protected routes
Layouts: Reusable layout components using component composition
